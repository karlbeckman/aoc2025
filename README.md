# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) programming challenges.

## Structure

Each day's solution is organized in its own directory:

- `day1/` - Day 1 solution
- `day2/` - Day 2 solution
- `day3/` - Day 3 solution
- etc.

Each day directory contains:

- `main.py` - The solution implementation
- `input.txt` - The puzzle input
- `test_input.txt` - Example input for testing

## Usage

To run a solution:

```bash
cd dayX
python3 main.py input.txt
```

## Utilities

The `util/` directory contains shared utilities:

- `Parser` class for reading and parsing input files
- Common enums and helper functions
